ISA is the set of commands the CU (see [[CPU]])will use to decode binary.

different architectures have different ISA, so RSIV has a set length while x86 has a longer difficult mess with no set length. (x86 is also used all over the world so)

for example
```
0000 0100 0010
```
(not real example)

The CU will read this binary, and depending on the ISA (lets say add= 0000)
the CU will then read this as an ADD. 
All ISA are different from CPU to CPU.
